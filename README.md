Statistical Learning for Overestimated Population Adjustments

Here we share our workflows/R-scripts for using classifiers/ensembles and evaluating them, in order to predict the status of individuals (as present or absent) from a given population, provided a set of their attributes (demographic, social) are known.

Our original nickname for this project: "the children in the candy bar", since so many algorithms and thus R-packages are available for solving the problem :)

The code for a random forest classification of individuals, optimised for performance measures and undersampling when using unbalanced training data can be found at: https://github.com/MargheritaZ/ML-Census2021. Two papers presented at NTTS-2021 (https://coms.events/NTTS2021/en/) and NSM-2022 (https://www.nsm2022.is/) conferences are shared here as well.
