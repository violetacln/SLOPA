Statistical Learning for Overestimated Population Adjustments

Here we share our workflows/R-scripts for using classifiers/ensembles and evaluating them, in order to predict status of individuals (as present or absent) from a given population, provided a set of their attributes (demographic, social) are known.

Our nickname for this project: "the children in the candy bar", where R-packages and solutions are the candies :)
